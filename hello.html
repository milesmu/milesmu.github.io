            <h3>About Me and My Passion for Running</h3>
            <p>
                Running has become more than just a hobby for me, it's a way of life that challenges me physically and mentally every single day. As a junior at Northeastern University pursuing a degree in Business Administration and Data Science, I've learned to balance the demands of rigorous academics with the discipline required for marathon training. My journey into distance running began with shorter races, but I quickly discovered that the real test of endurance and mental fortitude comes from pushing myself through longer distances like half marathons and full marathons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the numbers and training plans, running has taught me invaluable life lessons about perseverance, goal-setting, and the importance of showing up even when motivation is low.
