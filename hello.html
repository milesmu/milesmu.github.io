            <h3>About Me and My Passion for Running</h3>
            <p>
                Running has become more than just a hobby for me—it's a way of life that challenges me physically and mentally every single day. As a junior at Northeastern University pursuing dual degrees in Business Administration and Data Science, I've learned to balance the demands of rigorous academics with the discipline required for marathon training. My journey into distance running began with shorter races, but I quickly discovered that the real test of endurance and mental fortitude comes from pushing myself through longer distances like half marathons and full marathons.

            <p>
                Currently, I maintain a consistent training schedule of around 40 miles per week, carefully tracking my progress and performance metrics to optimize my training. This data-driven approach to running aligns perfectly with my studies in data science—I analyze everything from pace variations to recovery times, using insights to continuously improve my performance. My recent achievements include running an 8K in 30:50 and a 5K in 18:00, times that represent countless early morning runs, interval training sessions, and long weekend miles. I use my Garmin Forerunner 965 to capture every detail of my training, allowing me to understand patterns and make informed decisions about my workouts.

            <p>
                Beyond the numbers and training plans, running has taught me invaluable life lessons about perseverance, goal-setting, and the importance of showing up even when motivation is low. Whether I'm balancing my responsibilities as a Resident Assistant, working my co-op at TD Securities, serving as President of Out In Business, or teaching as a CS 1210 TA, I always make time for my runs. The mental clarity I gain from a morning run often translates into better focus throughout my day. Marathon training has become a metaphor for how I approach challenges in all areas of my life—with patience, strategy, and an unwavering commitment to crossing the finish line.
